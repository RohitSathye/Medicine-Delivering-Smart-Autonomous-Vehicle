# Medicine-Delivering-Smart-Autonomous-Vehicle
This repository contains the programs for my Bachelors Final Project titled - Medicine Delivering Smart Autonomous Vehicle. This repo contains 4 codes with 3 for the operation of Medicine Dispensing and 3 different variants for movement of the vehicle. The Project was designed and presented in December 2019.

The Following Codes can be run on an Arduino IDE. 
The Programs - Final_Line_Follower , New_Sensor_Line_Follow_2 and Stop_check were run on the Arduino UNO Board
The Program - Master_and_Thingspeak_Final was run on the Arduino Mega Board. 

Final_Line_Follower , New_Sensor_Line_Follow_2 and Stop_check are the 3 variants of line following code implemented in the project. They were tested for optimization and accuracy.
